# Calorify API
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saipanindra/CalorifyAPI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saipanindra/CalorifyAPI)

## Overview
API that backs Calorify App.

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, navigate to `api` directory (`cd api`), then run:

```
npm start
```

To view the API Docs 
```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
